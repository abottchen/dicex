 * Per-room record of which extensions the GM lets roll through Dice+.
 *
 * Kept in room metadata so every client reads the same answer and it lasts
 * as long as the room. Deny by default: a source in neither list must be
 * allowed by a GM before it can roll.
 *
 * This is a courtesy prompt. It stops rolls nobody asked for; it does not
 * stop impersonation. `source` is whatever the requesting extension writes,
 * so one extension can claim another's id. A per-source secret would not
 * help: OBR broadcasts and room metadata are readable by every extension in
 * the room, so a secret sent on `${source}/access` reaches the impostor too.
 * Room metadata is also writable by any client, so an extension on a
 * player's client could edit this list directly. Dicex only keeps its own
 * code from writing the list on a client that is not a GM's.
